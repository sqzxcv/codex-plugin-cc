description: Delegate investigation, an explicit fix request, or follow-up rescue work to the Codex rescue subagent

Invoke the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent via the `Agent` tool (`subagent_type: "codex:codex-rescue"`), forwarding the raw user request as the prompt.
`codex:codex-rescue` is a subagent, not a skill — do not call `Skill(codex:codex-rescue)` (no such skill) or `Skill(codex:rescue)` (that re-enters this command and hangs the session). The command runs inline so the `Agent` tool stays in scope; forked general-purpose subagents do not expose it.
The final user-visible response must be Codex's output verbatim.

Raw user request:
$ARGUMENTS

Execution mode:

- If the request includes `--background`, run the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent in the background using `run_in_background: true`, then set up completion monitoring:
  1. Parse the subagent's JSON output to extract `jobId`, `jobsDir`, and `signalFile`.
  2. Set up a completion watcher using the `Monitor` tool so the main thread is notified when the background worker finishes:
     ```
     Monitor:
       command: until [ -f "<signalFile>" ]; do sleep 2; done; echo "done $(cat <signalFile>)"
       description: "codex background task <jobId>"
       timeout_ms: 3600000
       persistent: false
     ```
     Replace `<signalFile>` and `<jobId>` with the actual values from step 1.
  3. When the Monitor fires (the worker wrote the `.done` signal file), call `PushNotification` to wake the main thread:
     ```
     PushNotification: "Codex task <jobId> finished: <status>. Run /codex:result <jobId> to see output."
     ```
     Extract `<status>` from the Monitor output line (`completed` or `failed`).
  4. Do not skip the Monitor setup. Do not poll `/codex:status` manually — rely on the Monitor to detect completion.
- If the request includes `--wait`, run the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent in the foreground.
- If neither flag is present, default to foreground.
- `--background` and `--wait` are execution flags for Claude Code. Do not forward them to `task`, and do not treat them as part of the natural-language task text.
- `--worktree` runs the task in an isolated git worktree. Codex works in `.claude/worktrees/<jobId>/` on a separate branch, leaving the main working directory untouched. `--worktree` and `--resume`/`--resume-last` are mutually exclusive. Preserve `--worktree` for the forwarded `task` call.
- `--model` and `--effort` are runtime-selection flags. Preserve them for the forwarded `task` call, but do not treat them as part of the natural-language task text.
- If the request includes `--resume`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- If the request includes `--fresh`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- Otherwise, before starting Codex, check for a resumable rescue thread from this Claude session by running:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" task-resume-candidate --json
```

- If that helper reports `available: true`, use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once to ask whether to continue the current Codex thread or start a new one.
- The two choices must be:
  - `Continue current Codex thread`
  - `Start a new Codex thread`
- If the user is clearly giving a follow-up instruction such as "continue", "keep going", "resume", "apply the top fix", or "dig deeper", put `Continue current Codex thread (Recommended)` first.
- Otherwise put `Start a new Codex thread (Recommended)` first.
- If the user chooses continue, add `--resume` before routing to the subagent.
- If the user chooses a new thread, add `--fresh` before routing to the subagent.
- If the helper reports `available: false`, do not ask. Route normally.

Operating rules:

- The subagent is a thin forwarder only. It should use one `Bash` call to invoke `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" task ...` and return that command's stdout as-is.
- Return the Codex companion stdout verbatim to the user.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, rewrite, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not ask the subagent to inspect files, monitor progress, poll `/codex:status`, fetch `/codex:result`, call `/codex:cancel`, summarize output, or do follow-up work of its own.
- Leave `--effort` unset unless the user explicitly asks for a specific reasoning effort.
- Leave the model unset unless the user explicitly asks for one. If they ask for `spark`, map it to `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`.
- Leave `--resume` and `--fresh` in the forwarded request. The subagent handles that routing when it builds the `task` command.
- If the helper reports that Codex is missing or unauthenticated, stop and tell the user to run `/codex:setup`.
- If the user did not supply a request, ask what Codex should investigate or fix.
- **Thread exclusivity**: While a Codex task is running, do not manually run `codex resume` on the same thread from a terminal. The Codex backend enforces single-turn exclusivity per thread, and attempting to resume an active thread will block or pause your CLI session. Wait for the task to complete (check `/codex:status`), or use `/codex:cancel` to stop the task first. If you need to run Codex in parallel, start a fresh thread with `codex` (without `--resume`).
