description: Delegate investigation, an explicit fix request, or follow-up rescue work to the Codex rescue subagent
argument-hint: "[--background|--wait] [--resume|--fresh] [--model <model|spark>] [--effort <none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh>] [what Codex should investigate, solve, or continue]"
allowed-tools: Bash(node:*), AskUserQuestion, Agent

Invoke the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent via the `Agent` tool (`subagent_type: "codex:codex-rescue"`), forwarding the raw user request as the prompt.
`codex:codex-rescue` is a subagent, not a skill — do not call `Skill(codex:codex-rescue)` (no such skill) or `Skill(codex:rescue)` (that re-enters this command and hangs the session). The command runs inline so the `Agent` tool stays in scope; forked general-purpose subagents do not expose it.
The final user-visible response must be Codex's output verbatim.

Raw user request:
$ARGUMENTS

Execution mode:

- If the request includes `--background`, run the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent in the background.
- If the request includes `--wait`, run the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent in the foreground.
- If neither flag is present, default to foreground.
- `--background` and `--wait` are execution flags for Claude Code. Do not forward them to `task`, and do not treat them as part of the natural-language task text.
- `--model` and `--effort` are runtime-selection flags. Preserve them for the forwarded `task` call, but do not treat them as part of the natural-language task text.
- If the request includes `--resume`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- If the request includes `--fresh`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- Otherwise, before starting Codex, check for a resumable rescue thread from this Claude session by running:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" task-resume-candidate --json
```

- If that helper reports `available: true`, use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once to ask whether to continue the current Codex thread or start a new one.
- The two choices must be:
  - `Continue current Codex thread`
  - `Start a new Codex thread`
- If the user is clearly giving a follow-up instruction such as "continue", "keep going", "resume", "apply the top fix", or "dig deeper", put `Continue current Codex thread (Recommended)` first.
- Otherwise put `Start a new Codex thread (Recommended)` first.
- If the user chooses continue, add `--resume` before routing to the subagent.
- If the user chooses a new thread, add `--fresh` before routing to the subagent.
- If the helper reports `available: false`, do not ask. Route normally.

Operating rules:

- The subagent is a thin forwarder only. It should use one `Bash` call to invoke `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" task ...` and return that command's stdout as-is.
- Return the Codex companion stdout verbatim to the user.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, rewrite, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not ask the subagent to inspect files, monitor progress, poll `/codex:status`, fetch `/codex:result`, call `/codex:cancel`, summarize output, or do follow-up work of its own.
- Leave `--effort` unset unless the user explicitly asks for a specific reasoning effort.
- Leave the model unset unless the user explicitly asks for one. If they ask for `spark`, map it to `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`.
- Leave `--resume` and `--fresh` in the forwarded request. The subagent handles that routing when it builds the `task` command.
- If the helper reports that Codex is missing or unauthenticated, stop and tell the user to run `/codex:setup`.
- If the user did not supply a request, check for a saved review from `/codex:review` or `/codex:adversarial-review`:
```bash
node -e "const {execSync:x}=require('child_process'),os=require('os'),fs=require('fs'),c=require('crypto');let t;try{t=x('git rev-parse --show-toplevel',{encoding:'utf8'}).trim()}catch(e){t=null};const h=t?c.createHash('md5').update(t).digest('hex'):'global';const p=os.homedir()+'/.codex/last-review-'+h+'.md';console.log(fs.existsSync(p)?'LAST_REVIEW_AVAILABLE':'NO_LAST_REVIEW');"
```
  - If `LAST_REVIEW_AVAILABLE`: use `AskUserQuestion` once with two options:
    - `Fix issues from last review (Recommended)` — prepend the saved review content as context for the rescue task
    - `Describe a new task` — ask what Codex should investigate or fix
  - If the user chooses to fix from last review, read the review file with node and include it verbatim prefixed with: "The following issues were found in a prior Codex review. Please fix them:\n\n"
```bash
node -e "const {execSync:x}=require('child_process'),os=require('os'),fs=require('fs'),c=require('crypto');let t;try{t=x('git rev-parse --show-toplevel',{encoding:'utf8'}).trim()}catch(e){t=null};const h=t?c.createHash('md5').update(t).digest('hex'):'global';process.stdout.write(fs.readFileSync(os.homedir()+'/.codex/last-review-'+h+'.md','utf8'));"
```
  - If `NO_LAST_REVIEW`: ask what Codex should investigate or fix.
