# Codex plugin for Claude Code

Use Codex from inside Claude Code as a second model family — to critique a design before you build it, adversarially review completed work, or delegate a task to Codex.

This plugin is for Claude Code users who want an easy way to start using Codex from the workflow
they already have.

## What You Get

Codex is a **second model family** you reach for in two situations, plus a workhorse for delegation:

- `/codex:critique` — hand it a **design, before you build it**. Codex reads the code *and* queries the live database, then attacks the design where the data doesn't back it up.
- `/codex:adversarial-review` — an adversarial review of **completed work**. The one review command: it challenges the approach, not just the diff.
- `/codex:rescue`, `/codex:status`, `/codex:result`, and `/codex:cancel` — delegate a task to Codex and manage background jobs.

## Requirements

- **ChatGPT subscription (incl. Free) or OpenAI API key.**
  - Usage will contribute to your Codex usage limits. [Learn more](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing).
- **Node.js 18.18 or later**

## Install

Add the marketplace in Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc
```

Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install codex@openai-codex
```

Reload plugins:

```bash
/reload-plugins
```

Then run:

```bash
/codex:setup
```

`/codex:setup` will tell you whether Codex is ready. If Codex is missing and npm is available, it can offer to install Codex for you.

If you prefer to install Codex yourself, use:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

If Codex is installed but not logged in yet, run:

```bash
!codex login
```

After install, you should see:

- the slash commands listed below
- the `codex:codex-rescue` and `codex:codex-critique` subagents in `/agents`

One simple first run is:

```bash
/codex:adversarial-review --background
/codex:status
/codex:result
```

## Usage

### `/codex:critique`

Hands Codex a **design — before you build it** — for an independent, second-family critique. Codex has full read access to the repository *and*, where a database or MCP tool is available, the live data. It verifies each load-bearing claim in the design against the code (`file:line`) and the data (the actual query and its result), and leads with where the design does *not* hold up.

Reach for this when Claude has produced or endorsed a design and you want a different model to attack it before it gets built — not to review a finished diff (that's [`/codex:adversarial-review`](#codexadversarial-review)) and not to run a task (that's [`/codex:rescue`](#codexrescue)).

Pass the design inline, or point at a design doc:

```bash
/codex:critique docs/design/new-cache-layer.md
/codex:critique --focus "the n is tiny — does the data even support this split?" we plan to ...
```

It is read-only and returns the critique directly. Because it reads the whole repo and queries the database, it usually runs long, so by default it runs as a background subagent and notifies you when the critique is ready; add `--wait` to run it inline instead.

### `/codex:adversarial-review`

Runs a **steerable** review that questions the chosen implementation and design.

It can be used to pressure-test assumptions, tradeoffs, failure modes, and whether a different approach would have been safer or simpler.

It reviews your current uncommitted changes by default, or your branch against a base with `--base <ref>`.
It also supports `--wait` and `--background`, and takes extra focus text after the flags to steer what it scrutinizes.

Use it when you want:

- a review before shipping that challenges the direction, not just the code details
- review focused on design choices, tradeoffs, hidden assumptions, and alternative approaches
- pressure-testing around specific risk areas like auth, data loss, rollback, race conditions, or reliability

Examples:

```bash
/codex:adversarial-review
/codex:adversarial-review --base main challenge whether this was the right caching and retry design
/codex:adversarial-review --background look for race conditions and question the chosen approach
```

This command is read-only. It does not fix code.

### `/codex:rescue`

Hands a task to Codex through the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent.

Use it when you want Codex to:

- investigate a bug
- try a fix
- continue a previous Codex task
- take a faster or cheaper pass with a smaller model

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the task and the model you choose these tasks might take a long time and it's generally recommended to force the task to be in the background or move the agent to the background.

It supports `--background`, `--wait`, `--resume`, and `--fresh`. If you omit `--resume` and `--fresh`, the plugin can offer to continue the latest rescue thread for this repo.

Examples:

```bash
/codex:rescue investigate why the tests started failing
/codex:rescue fix the failing test with the smallest safe patch
/codex:rescue --resume apply the top fix from the last run
/codex:rescue --model gpt-5.4-mini --effort medium investigate the flaky integration test
/codex:rescue --model spark fix the issue quickly
/codex:rescue --background investigate the regression
```

You can also just ask for a task to be delegated to Codex:

```text
Ask Codex to redesign the database connection to be more resilient.
```

**Notes:**

- if you do not pass `--model` or `--effort`, Codex chooses its own defaults.
- if you say `spark`, the plugin maps that to `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`
- follow-up rescue requests can continue the latest Codex task in the repo

### `/codex:status`

Shows running and recent Codex jobs for the current repository.

Examples:

```bash
/codex:status
/codex:status task-abc123
```

Use it to:

- check progress on background work
- see the latest completed job
- confirm whether a task is still running

### `/codex:result`

Shows the final stored Codex output for a finished job.
When available, it also includes the Codex session ID so you can reopen that run directly in Codex with `codex resume <session-id>`.

Examples:

```bash
/codex:result
/codex:result task-abc123
```

### `/codex:cancel`

Cancels an active background Codex job.

Examples:

```bash
/codex:cancel
/codex:cancel task-abc123
```

### `/codex:setup`

Checks whether Codex is installed and authenticated.
If Codex is missing and npm is available, it can offer to install Codex for you.

You can also use `/codex:setup` to manage the optional review gate.

#### Enabling review gate

```bash
/codex:setup --enable-review-gate
/codex:setup --disable-review-gate
```

When the review gate is enabled, the plugin uses a `Stop` hook to run a targeted Codex review based on Claude's response. If that review finds issues, the stop is blocked so Claude can address them first.

> [!WARNING]
> The review gate can create a long-running Claude/Codex loop and may drain usage limits quickly. Only enable it when you plan to actively monitor the session.

## Typical Flows

### Critique A Design Before Building

```bash
/codex:critique docs/design/new-cache-layer.md
```

### Review Before Shipping

```bash
/codex:adversarial-review
```

### Hand A Problem To Codex

```bash
/codex:rescue investigate why the build is failing in CI
```

### Start Something Long-Running

```bash
/codex:adversarial-review --background
/codex:rescue --background investigate the flaky test
```

Then check in with:

```bash
/codex:status
/codex:result
```

## Codex Integration

The Codex plugin wraps the [Codex app server](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server). It uses the global `codex` binary installed in your environment and [applies the same configuration](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic).

### Common Configurations

If you want to change the default reasoning effort or the default model that gets used by the plugin, you can define that inside your user-level or project-level `config.toml`. For example to always use `gpt-5.4-mini` on `high` for a specific project you can add the following to a `.codex/config.toml` file at the root of the directory you started Claude in:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.4-mini"
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
```

Your configuration will be picked up based on:

- user-level config in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- project-level overrides in `.codex/config.toml`
- project-level overrides only load when the [project is trusted](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-advanced#project-config-files-codexconfigtoml)

Check out the Codex docs for more [configuration options](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference).

### Moving The Work Over To Codex

Delegated tasks and any [stop gate](#what-does-the-review-gate-do) run can also be directly resumed inside Codex by running `codex resume` either with the specific session ID you received from running `/codex:result` or `/codex:status` or by selecting it from the list.

This way you can review the Codex work or continue the work there.

## FAQ

### Do I need a separate Codex account for this plugin?

If you are already signed into Codex on this machine, that account should work immediately here too. This plugin uses your local Codex CLI authentication.

If you only use Claude Code today and have not used Codex yet, you will also need to sign in to Codex with either a ChatGPT account or an API key. [Codex is available with your ChatGPT subscription](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing/), and [`codex login`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#codex-login) supports both ChatGPT and API key sign-in. Run `/codex:setup` to check whether Codex is ready, and use `!codex login` if it is not.

### Does the plugin use a separate Codex runtime?

No. This plugin delegates through your local [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) and [Codex app server](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server/) on the same machine.

That means:

- it uses the same Codex install you would use directly
- it uses the same local authentication state
- it uses the same repository checkout and machine-local environment

### Will it use the same Codex config I already have?

Yes. If you already use Codex, the plugin picks up the same [configuration](#common-configurations).

### Can I keep using my current API key or base URL setup?

Yes. Because the plugin uses your local Codex CLI, your existing sign-in method and config still apply.

If you need to point the built-in OpenAI provider at a different endpoint, set `openai_base_url` in your [Codex config](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-advanced/#config-and-state-locations).
