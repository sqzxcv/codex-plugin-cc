## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Terminal detection

The spawner SHALL inspect the process environment to determine whether a supported terminal multiplexer or emulator hosts the current shell, returning a tagged kind that the dispatcher uses to select a backend.

#### Scenario: tmux is detected when $TMUX is set

- **WHEN** `process.env.TMUX` is a non-empty string
- **THEN** detection returns `{ kind: 'tmux' }`

#### Scenario: ghostty-mac is detected on macOS Ghostty

- **WHEN** `process.platform === 'darwin'` AND `process.env.TERM_PROGRAM === 'ghostty'` AND `process.env.TMUX` is unset or empty
- **THEN** detection returns `{ kind: 'ghostty-mac' }`

#### Scenario: iterm2-mac is detected on macOS iTerm2

- **WHEN** `process.platform === 'darwin'` AND `process.env.TERM_PROGRAM === 'iTerm.app'` AND `process.env.TMUX` is unset or empty
- **THEN** detection returns `{ kind: 'iterm2-mac' }`

#### Scenario: none is returned when no supported terminal matches

- **WHEN** no detection condition holds (e.g., running in plain Terminal.app, Alacritty, an SSH session, or a non-macOS shell)
- **THEN** detection returns `{ kind: 'none' }`

### Requirement: Detection precedence

When multiple terminal signals are present simultaneously, the spawner SHALL prefer the multiplexer over the host emulator so that users running tmux inside Ghostty or iTerm2 still get the tmux split.

#### Scenario: tmux inside Ghostty selects tmux

- **WHEN** `process.env.TMUX` is set AND `process.env.TERM_PROGRAM === 'ghostty'`
- **THEN** detection returns `{ kind: 'tmux' }` (Ghostty is ignored)

#### Scenario: tmux inside iTerm2 selects tmux

- **WHEN** `process.env.TMUX` is set AND `process.env.TERM_PROGRAM === 'iTerm.app'`
- **THEN** detection returns `{ kind: 'tmux' }` (iTerm2 is ignored)

### Requirement: Backend dispatch

The spawner SHALL select the backend matching the detected kind and invoke it through the injectable runner so that all backends remain unit-testable without invoking real `tmux` or `osascript`.

#### Scenario: tmux backend calls tmux split-window

- **WHEN** kind is `tmux`
- **THEN** the runner is invoked with `cmd === 'tmux'` and `args` starts with `['split-window', '-h', '-c', <cwd>, <command>]`

#### Scenario: ghostty-mac backend calls osascript

- **WHEN** kind is `ghostty-mac`
- **THEN** the runner is invoked with `cmd === 'osascript'`
- **AND** `args` is a sequence of `-e <line>` pairs whose concatenated script contains `tell application "Ghostty"`, `set newWin to new window`, `set newTerm to terminal 1 of selected tab of newWin` (because Ghostty's `new window` returns a window — `input text` requires a terminal), and an `input text "..." to newTerm` call carrying the supplied command. The script MUST NOT reference `tty of <terminal>` (Ghostty 1.3's terminal object exposes `id`, `name`, `working directory` only — no `tty` property; tty-targeted split is deferred until upstream adds it).

#### Scenario: iterm2-mac backend calls osascript

- **WHEN** kind is `iterm2-mac`
- **THEN** the runner is invoked with `cmd === 'osascript'`
- **AND** `args` is a sequence of `-e <line>` pairs whose concatenated script contains `tell application "iTerm"`, a nested `repeat with w in windows` / `repeat with tb in tabs of w` / `repeat with s in sessions of tb` traversal (iTerm2's object model is window → tabs → sessions; `sessions` is NOT a direct element of `window`) comparing `tty of s` to the caller-tty argument, a `split vertically with default profile` branch when a match is found, a `create window with default profile` plus `current session of newWindow` branch when no match is found, and a `write text` call carrying the supplied command

### Requirement: Spawn success reporting

On a successful spawn, the spawner SHALL return `{ spawned: true, kind: <detected-kind> }` so that `handleObserveSpawn` can name the actual backend in its success message.

#### Scenario: backend exits zero

- **WHEN** the runner returns `{ status: 0 }` for any detected backend
- **THEN** the spawner result is `{ spawned: true, kind: <that-backend> }` (no `error` field)

### Requirement: Spawn failure reporting

On a non-zero runner status or a thrown runner error that is NOT one of the carved-out classes (`automation-permission-denied`, `unsafe-command`), the spawner SHALL return `{ spawned: false, kind: <detected-kind>, error: <human-readable-message> }` so that `handleObserveSpawn` can show the error and fall through to the copy-paste hint.

#### Scenario: backend exits non-zero with no recognized reason

- **WHEN** the runner returns `{ status: 1 }` for any detected backend AND stderr does not match the permission-denied pattern
- **THEN** the spawner result is `{ spawned: false, kind: <that-backend>, error: <string mentioning the backend command and exit status> }` (no `reason` field)

#### Scenario: backend binary missing or runner throws

- **WHEN** the runner returns `{ status: null, error: <Error> }` (e.g., `ENOENT` for `osascript` on a non-macOS system that was mis-detected)
- **THEN** the spawner result is `{ spawned: false, kind: <that-backend>, error: <string including the error message> }`

### Requirement: No-supported-terminal fallback

When detection returns `{ kind: 'none' }`, the spawner MUST NOT invoke any runner and SHALL return `{ spawned: false, kind: 'none' }` so the caller knows to print only the copy-paste hint (no per-backend failure line).

#### Scenario: outside any supported terminal

- **WHEN** detection returns `{ kind: 'none' }`
- **THEN** the runner is not called
- **AND** the spawner result is `{ spawned: false, kind: 'none' }` (no `error` field)

### Requirement: AppleScript literal escaping (osascript backends only)

The `ghostty-mac` and `iterm2-mac` backends SHALL escape backslash and double-quote characters in the interpolated shell command (the output of `composeShellInvocation`, after the control-character guard) so that the observer command — as constructed by the spawner's own `buildObserverCommand` helper plus the shell-quoting layer in the requirement above — cannot break the surrounding `"..."` literal. The escape function MUST NOT be claimed safe against arbitrary user-controlled strings; the control-character rejection requirement is what enforces that input domain. The `tmux` backend does not build AppleScript and is exempt from this requirement.

#### Scenario: command contains a double-quote

- **WHEN** the composed shell command (after shell-quoting) contains `"`
- **THEN** the produced AppleScript contains `\"` at each occurrence inside its `"..."` literal

#### Scenario: command contains a backslash

- **WHEN** the composed shell command (after shell-quoting) contains `\`
- **THEN** the produced AppleScript contains `\\` at each occurrence inside its `"..."` literal

### Requirement: Shell-safe composition of cwd and command (osascript backends only)

For the `ghostty-mac` and `iterm2-mac` backends, the spawner SHALL produce the final shell invocation via a single `composeShellInvocation({ cwd, command })` helper that returns exactly `cd ${shellQuote(cwd)} && ${command}` — `cwd` is shell-quoted *here* (single-quote escaping, doubling internal `'` as `'\''`), and `command` MUST be the output of `buildObserverCommand` in `observe.mjs`, which is a space-joined sequence of already-individually-shell-quoted argv tokens. `command` MUST NOT be re-quoted by this layer; doing so would collapse the argv tokens into a single literal string and break execution. The `tmux` backend passes `cwd` and `command` as separate `execve` args to `tmux` and does not call `composeShellInvocation`; it is exempt from this requirement.

The two quoting layers MUST run in this exact order, with no intervening transformation:

1. `composeShellInvocation({ cwd, command })` — shell-safe composition (Layer 1).
2. `escapeAppleScriptLiteral(<step-1 result>)` — AppleScript-literal-safe (Layer 2).

The control-character guard (separate requirement below) runs *between* Layers 1 and 2.

#### Scenario: cwd contains spaces

- **WHEN** `cwd` is `/Users/dragon.cl/work projects/codex-plugin-cc`
- **THEN** the composed string starts with `cd '/Users/dragon.cl/work projects/codex-plugin-cc' && ` (cwd wrapped in single quotes)

#### Scenario: cwd contains a single quote

- **WHEN** `cwd` is `/tmp/it's-a-trap`
- **THEN** the composed string starts with `cd '/tmp/it'\''s-a-trap' && ` (single quote escaped as `'\''`)

#### Scenario: cwd contains shell metacharacters

- **WHEN** `cwd` is `/tmp/foo;rm -rf /;`
- **THEN** the composed string is `cd '/tmp/foo;rm -rf /;' && <command>` and the embedded `;`/space/etc. are inside the single-quoted literal and have no shell effect

#### Scenario: cwd contains unicode

- **WHEN** `cwd` is `/Users/田中/プロジェクト`
- **THEN** the composed string contains the original unicode bytes verbatim inside the single-quoted literal

#### Scenario: command argv tokens are preserved as separate tokens

- **WHEN** `command` is `'/abs/node' '/abs/companion.mjs' 'observe' 'task-abc'` (four already-shell-quoted argv tokens as produced by `buildObserverCommand`)
- **THEN** the composed string ends with ` && '/abs/node' '/abs/companion.mjs' 'observe' 'task-abc'` — the four tokens are preserved verbatim with their original single quotes, NOT re-quoted into a single literal

#### Scenario: command containing apparent shell metacharacters in a quoted token is unchanged

- **WHEN** `command` is `'/abs/node' '/abs/companion.mjs' 'observe' 'task with$weird;chars'`
- **THEN** the composed string ends with that exact string verbatim — the spawner does NOT add another layer of `shellQuote` around `command`

#### Scenario: layer order — composeShellInvocation runs before escapeAppleScriptLiteral

- **WHEN** the spawner builds an osascript backend's argv
- **THEN** the input to `escapeAppleScriptLiteral` is exactly the output of `composeShellInvocation` — there is no path that escapes raw `cwd` or raw `command` for AppleScript before shell composition has produced the final invocation

### Requirement: Caller-terminal targeting with new-window fallback (iterm2-mac only)

The `iterm2-mac` backend SHALL discover the caller shell's controlling tty (walking the process ancestry until an ancestor with a real tty is found) and pass that path into the AppleScript. The AppleScript SHALL iterate `windows -> tabs -> sessions` and split the session whose `tty` matches; when no match is found OR tty discovery itself fails, the script SHALL open a brand-new window for the observer. It MUST NOT silently split an unrelated front window.

The `ghostty-mac` backend is exempt from caller-tty targeting because Ghostty 1.3's `terminal` object exposes no `tty` property; this backend always uses the new-window path. When upstream Ghostty adds a `tty` property, this exemption SHALL be revisited.

The `tmux` backend uses tmux's own client-context split (`split-window -h -c <cwd>`) and is also exempt.

#### Scenario: caller tty matches an open iTerm2 session

- **WHEN** the caller-tty argument equals the `tty` of one of iTerm2's open sessions
- **THEN** the AppleScript splits *that* session vertically and runs the command in the new session

#### Scenario: no matching iTerm2 session found

- **WHEN** no open iTerm2 session has a `tty` matching the caller-tty argument
- **THEN** the AppleScript opens a new iTerm2 window via `create window with default profile` (NOT a split of the front window), assigns `current session of newWindow`, and writes the command into that session

#### Scenario: caller tty cannot be discovered (iTerm2)

- **WHEN** process-ancestry discovery returns no tty (e.g., sandboxed shell, `ps` unavailable)
- **THEN** the spawner builds iTerm2 AppleScript that goes directly to the `create window` branch with no split attempt and no `repeat` loop

#### Scenario: Ghostty always uses new-window path

- **WHEN** the kind is `ghostty-mac`, regardless of whether tty discovery succeeded
- **THEN** the AppleScript always executes `set newWin to new window` followed by `set newTerm to terminal 1 of selected tab of newWin`, then `input text` to that terminal — the script does not embed the caller tty and does not contain a `repeat with` loop

### Requirement: Reject control characters in the composed shell invocation (osascript backends only)

For the `ghostty-mac` and `iterm2-mac` backends, after `composeShellInvocation({ cwd, command })` has produced the final `cd <quoted-cwd> && <command>` string and BEFORE `escapeAppleScriptLiteral` runs, the spawner SHALL scan that exact composed string for ASCII control bytes in the range `0x00`–`0x1F` other than `0x09` (tab) and `0x20` (space). On any hit, the spawner SHALL return `{ spawned: false, kind: <detected-kind>, reason: 'unsafe-command', error: <human-readable-message naming the offending byte and where in the composed string it appeared> }` and MUST NOT invoke the runner or proceed to AppleScript escaping. Scanning the composed string (not the raw `cwd` or raw `command` in isolation) is mandatory so that control bytes embedded in `cwd` are caught before they reach `input text` / `write text`. The `tmux` backend is exempt because it passes `cwd` via `-c <cwd>` and the command as a separate `execve` arg — no AppleScript-literal injection vector exists.

#### Scenario: cwd contains an embedded newline

- **WHEN** `cwd` is `/tmp/foo\nbar` (literal newline in the path) and `command` is well-formed
- **THEN** `composeShellInvocation` produces a composed string whose single-quoted cwd literal contains `\n`, the control-char scan detects it, the spawner returns `{ spawned: false, kind: <detected-kind>, reason: 'unsafe-command', error: <string mentioning embedded newline and the cwd location> }`, and the runner is not called

#### Scenario: command contains an embedded newline

- **WHEN** the composed shell invocation contains `\n` originating from `command`
- **THEN** the spawner returns `{ spawned: false, kind: <detected-kind>, reason: 'unsafe-command', error: <string mentioning embedded newline> }` and the runner is not called

#### Scenario: composed string contains a NUL byte

- **WHEN** the composed string contains `\0` (from either `cwd` or `command`)
- **THEN** the spawner returns `{ spawned: false, kind: <detected-kind>, reason: 'unsafe-command', error: <string mentioning NUL> }` and the runner is not called

#### Scenario: composed string contains a carriage return

- **WHEN** the composed string contains `\r` (from either `cwd` or `command`)
- **THEN** the spawner returns `{ spawned: false, kind: <detected-kind>, reason: 'unsafe-command', error: <string mentioning embedded control character> }` and the runner is not called

#### Scenario: tab and space are allowed

- **WHEN** the composed string contains `\t` (0x09) or `\x20` (space)
- **THEN** the scan does NOT trigger; the spawner proceeds to `escapeAppleScriptLiteral` and the runner is invoked normally

### Requirement: Automation-permission-denied messaging

When an osascript backend fails because the user has not granted Automation permission, the spawner SHALL classify the failure as `automation-permission-denied` (distinct from generic spawn failure), and `handleObserveSpawn` SHALL print a single dedicated message instructing the user to grant access and retry — without printing the generic copy-paste fallback hint.

#### Scenario: osascript stderr contains the documented permission error number

- **WHEN** the runner returns `{ status: 1, stderr: <string containing '(-1743)'> }`
- **THEN** the spawner result is `{ spawned: false, kind: <detected-kind>, reason: 'automation-permission-denied', error: <human-readable message> }`

#### Scenario: osascript stderr contains the "not authorized" phrase

- **WHEN** the runner returns `{ status: 1, stderr: <string containing 'not authorized to send Apple events' case-insensitive> }`
- **THEN** the spawner result is `{ spawned: false, kind: <detected-kind>, reason: 'automation-permission-denied', error: <human-readable message> }`

#### Scenario: handleObserveSpawn prints the dedicated permission message

- **WHEN** the spawner returns a result with `reason === 'automation-permission-denied'`
- **THEN** `handleObserveSpawn` prints a single line of the form `! macOS Automation permission needed for <Ghostty|iTerm2>. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation, enable <app>, then rerun /codex:observe.`
- **AND** does NOT print the generic copy-paste fallback hint
